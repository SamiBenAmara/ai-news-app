                You are going to write a JSON full of possible exam questions / flash cards with the following notes.
                Do 10 each.

                Consider the following TypeScript Interface for the JSON schema:

                interface MultiChoiceQuestion {
                    question: string;
                    possible_answers: string[];
                    correct_answer: int;
                }

                interface TrueFalseQuestion {
                    question: string;
                    correct_answer: boolean;
                }

                interface Flashcard {

                   topic: string;
                }

                Write the basics section according to the JSON schema.
                On the response, include only the JSON.
