      U11:Integumentary System
Includes the:
Skin
Hair
Glands
Sebaceous
Sudoriferous (sweat)
ceruminous
Nails
Sensory Receptors
Mechanoreceptors
Thermoreceptors
nociceptors
Skin is 7% of bw and is one of the largest and heaviest organs
Functions:
Physical protection
Mechanical protection
Keratin in outermost layer
Prevents dehydration
Lipid secretions from skin cells via glands
UV light protection
Melanin in melanocytes absorbs UV radiation
Antimicrobial
Sebaceous glands
Langerhans cells
Macrophages
Immunity
Langerhan cells very important, they alter the immune system of a pathogen
Temperature Regulation (evaporation/production of sweat)
Sweat glands secrete sweat when hot
Blood vessels dilate in response to heat and constrict in response to cold
Cutaneous Sensation
Contains free and encapsulated nerve endings
Lamellated corpuscle 
Meissner's Corpuscle
Ruffini Corpuscle
Synthesis of Vitamin D precursor
UV light triggers a reaction for vitamin D production
Vitamin D increases the absorption of Ca and PO in the intestine
Structure of the Skin
There are three layers of the skin:
Epidermis
Composed of epithelial tissue as the name suggests
Dermis
Mostly connective tissue, but also contains some muscle and nerve tissues.
The layer under the skin is called the hypodermis (subcutaneous layer)
Mainly adipose and areolar connective tissue
Epidermis
Key characteristics of this layer are:
Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium
Avascular
4 types of cells found
4 or 5 distinct (strata) layers of cells
Cell Types
Keratinocyte
Produce keratin
Most numerous of the epidermal cells
Melanocyte
Produce melanin pigment
Melanin transferred to keratinocytes through long cellular processes
Melanin protects us from UV and is reason for skin colour
Langerhans
Helps the immune response
Is from the bone marrow
Ingests foreign substances
Merkel
Involved in sensing
Found in the deepest layer
Forms the touch receptor with sensory neuron
Within the epidermis, cells are full of keratin. As the cells progressively die, the cells accumulate keratin to the top of the layer and new cells move upwards. And new cells are subsequently produced in the deepest layer.
Stratum Basale
Is a single layer of cells
Mainly composed of active cells in the epidermis
Mostly keratinocytes, melanocytes and Merkel cells. Keratinocytes are dividing here and replenish layers above

Stratum Spinosum
Composed of 8-10 layers of cells
Mostly keratinocytes
A few langerhan cells are found here as well as cellular projections of melanocytes

Stratum Granulosum
3-5 layers
Flat dying keratinocytes
Undergo nuclear degeneration
Keratinization occurs at this layer

Stratum Lucidum
3-6 layers
This stratum only present in THICK skin
Clear and flat dead keratinocytes
Cells contain a lot of keratin

Stratum Corneum
20-50 layers
Very thin dead keratinocytes
Filled with keratin
The cells are continuously shed
This stratum is barrier for light, heat, water, chemicals, bacteria
Friction stimulates production of new cells
